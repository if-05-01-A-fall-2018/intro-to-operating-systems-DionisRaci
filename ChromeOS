ChromeOS:

ChromeOS or "Google Chrome OS" was first released in June 2011 by the company "Google".
It runs on x84, x64 and ARMv7 Architectures.
ChromeOS supports Chrome apps as well as Android application. In 2016 the access to the Google Play Store and all it's applications was made available.
It is pre-installed on all hardwares of Google's manufacturing partners, and only available by buying those products.
Chromium OS on the other hand, which is an open source equivalent which ChromeOS is based off, is available to download though.

Features:
ChromeOS and Chromium OS were described as a three-tier architecture: browser and window manager.
The firmware contributes to fast boot time by not probing for hardware, and it also contributes to security by verifying each step in the boot sequence and incorporating system recovery.
System-level software includes the Linux kernel that has been patched to improve boot performance.
The window manager handles user interaction with multiple client windows.

ChromeOS's Hardware:
Chromebooks are laptops running on the ChromeOS, which were also designed by Google.
A year later, a desktop version of the Chromebooks called "Chromebox" was released by Samsung.
ChromeOS let's you install custom Linux applications via LXC virtual machines on most chromebook models.
